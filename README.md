# Forgotten Items

- Author: Jake Wilson

The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the largest and best-known galleries in the world. Each year its collection of nearly 300,000 works of art are seen by around 1.5 million visitors.

However, not all works get the attention they deserve. Some artworks remain unloved in dusty corners of the museum, others aren't even on display.

I decided to create a Python programme which the AIC's public API to find artworks that haven't been viewed very often, to highlight the lesser-known works in its collection.

The programme returns text info about the object, it's maker, its date, and where to find it in the gallery, along with a web link. This can be set to a MOTD or a daily cron email.
